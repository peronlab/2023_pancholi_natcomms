Code for Pancholi et al. 2023, Nature Communications

This repository contains the code for figures in Pancholi et al., 2023, Nat.
Comms. "Learning in a sensory cortical microstimulation task is associated
with elevated representational stability". 

If you only downloaded the code, you will need to download the data using the
URL: http://peronlab.org/data/2023_pancholi_microstim_learning.zip

The one change you will need to make is to "get_all_data_pstim.m", where you
will need to set settings.base_dir to wherever the code lives. The assumption
is that there is a subdirectory, data, that contains all the data files. 

The figure-specific code is in the figure_X_YYY.m files, and there are some
supporting scripts also included.

If you have any problems or questions, please contact speron@nyu.edu.
